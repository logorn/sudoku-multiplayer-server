Simple RESTful API built on Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB with Mongoose

Here's a very basic tutorial of what we're trying to build [Creating RESTful APIs With NodeJS and MongoDB](http://adrianmejia.com/blog/2014/10/01/creating-a-restful-api-tutorial-with-nodejs-and-mongodb/)

We are going to build a RESTful architecture for both authentication and application logic in order to accomodate both the Android client and Web client [Architecting a Secure RESTful Node.js app](http://thejackalofjavascript.com/architecting-a-restful-node-js-app/)

### Installation 
[Official tutorial on installing Node.js on Unix system](http://www.joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm/)
There are far simpler tutorials if you perform a Google search (using a package manager), but this is the official one which tells you to manually compile the source.

Note that if you're on linux/Ubuntu, the `apt-get` package manager does have the latest version of Node.js and npm.
